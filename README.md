# MBTAgame
Idea that spawned between me and my SO. We sometimes randomly pick an MBTA station to visit that weekend as a data idea. We have to explore the area, and take a picture at the station.

Writing a fun, short program that randomly selects a MBTA station to visit. Currently envisioned as a command-line. May turn into a GUI project in the future.
